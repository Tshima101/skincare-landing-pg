    <p> We mean the basic care and keeping of your largest organâ€”your skin! It plays an important role in protecting
        you
        from outside pathogens and, you know, holds all your internal organs in place (phew). And in the same way
        that
        you regularly brush your teeth, your skin requires at least some attention to keep it functioning properly.
        It
        also requires protectionâ€”especially from skin cancer. At SELF, when we talk about skin care we're talking
        about
        science-backed ways to improve both the look and function of your skin to address and manage both cosmetic
        and
        medical concerns.This guide is for anyone who is curious about what it means or what it takes to have an
        effective skin-care routineâ€”from beginners who don't know where to start all the way to seasoned skin-care
        enthusiasts. Consider it our ultimate skin-care manual. </p>
